      <description>library(tidyverse) After loading in tidyverse, we will load in the datasets that show passer rating, wins, and all-purpose yards. All-purpose yardage is the sum of a player’s rushing and passing yards. Passer rating is essentially the rating at which the quarterback completed a game. Passer rating is calculated by taking into account completions, yardage, incompletions, interceptions, touchdowns, and attempts. A passer rating’s score can range from 0 to 158.</description>

      <title>Quarterback Passing Yardage</title>

      <description>As far as passing yardage goes, the process will be similar. This time, I’ll use a scatterplot chart to chart passing yardage with the exact same quarterbacks from each year. First, I’ll still load in tidyverse and the datasets, however these datasets will be passing focused.
library(tidyverse) library(ggbeeswarm) library(ggrepel) set.seed(1234) sevenpass &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;passingdata/2017QBPass.csv&amp;quot;) eightpass &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;passingdata/2018PassingStats.csv&amp;quot;) ninepass &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;passingdata/2019PassingStats.csv&amp;quot;) For 2017, we’ll still use Wilson, Prescott, Newton, Trubisky, Watson, and Mariota.</description>

      <description>As the National Football League begins to evolve, the most important position on the field evolves with it. The NFL has had a wide range of quarterbacks, ranging from strictly pocket passers to some that have more success using their legs. Pocket passers were the standard in the NFL for a long time, with some notable names being Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Phillip Rivers. Over time, the position has changed, and while their duties remain the same, their process and strategy changes as the game gets faster, smarter, and bigger.</description>
